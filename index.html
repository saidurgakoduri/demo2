                     antique jewelry. The phrase “antique jewelry” is generally used to refer to previously owned jewels as well as 
                     the jewelry items  crafted using earlier styles that were customarily associated with the era of yore, but it
                     does not necessarily mean pre-worn or handed down.Antique jewels are becoming highly wanted in the modern world 
                     and high quality gems used as well as their one of a kind rusty look.  Antique Indian jewelry can be well identified
                      by its distinctive design.</details>
