                <p>  Antique Jewellery is that which makes a statement of the old vintage designs, that is trendy on its own.
                     The gold plated antique jewellery designs go back in the day, inculcating traditional and rustic feel it.
                     Jewelry items that are older than 100 years and have witnessed the human evolution over these years constitute 
                     antique jewelry. The phrase “antique jewelry” is generally used to refer to previously owned jewels as well as 
                     the jewelry items  crafted using earlier styles that were customarily associated with the era of yore, but it
                     does not necessarily mean pre-worn or handed down.Antique jewels are becoming highly wanted in the modern world 
                     and high quality gems used as well as their one of a kind rusty look.  Antique Indian jewelry can be well identified
                      by its distinctive design.
